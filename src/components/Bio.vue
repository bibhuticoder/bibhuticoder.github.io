      <p>Hello, I am Bibhuti Poudyal, a programmer, designer, dreamer and an artist who
         likes art of every form.&nbsp;I am tech enthusiastic spending a lot of time with computer,
          learning and experimenting stuffs.</p>

      <p>I am 22 years old and currently pursuing Bachelors degree in CSIT 
        (Computer Science and Information Technology) at St. Xaviers College.</p>

      <p>Since childhood I was interested in scienc and art. My interest in computer evolved after my dad bought me a Pentium 4 
      computer when I was 8.
      <p>Unlike other programmers who start their journey from Qbasic or Flash, I started by making wallpapers,
       animations and games in Ms Powerpoint.</p>
      <p>I don't have many of them but here is a game built on Powerpoint. 
      Not much of game rather than a series of animations but I was really proud of it then. Its the one I 
      built when I was on grade 9.</p>

      <p>And its an animation video around the same time. Tools used: Ms powerpoint and Ms Paint.</p>

      <p>Then I started learning HTML, CSS at college. With basic knowledge of markup, designing and a bit of copy-paste Js I built some games. The one that I like most was Filmy Fun.</p>

      <p>At the final year of highschool, I began to study programming on my own to make the games more dynamic and interactive. Consecuently, I learned some C++ and Python. Then I was really impressed by the language C# and Visual Studio, the best IDE in the world. I programmed in C# for a year, made a lot of games and applications.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The best one was "<a href="http://flipkarma.com/project/nepal-loadshedding-schedule/">Nepal Loadshedding Schedule</a>". Because of this projects(and others too), I was ranked as the Second Top user at <a href="http://flipkarma.com/">Flipkarma</a>. All Other projects in C# are listed <a href="http://flipkarma.com/user/BibhutiAlmighty/">here</a>.</p>
      <p>High school finished and I'd six months gap. At that time I learned PHP, MySQl, Nodejs and MongoDb.
        Then I made a <a href="http://realtimeboard.herokuapp.com/">realtime whiteboard</a> in Nodejs using Socket.io.
         I coded all the frontend drawing app from scratch including all the brushes too.
          That time I thought it was not so good. 
          After two years the same project resulted 1st Prize in Happy Coding competition by CAN.</p>
      
      <p><img src="https://scontent.fktm8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/18198487_1489525037777754_8521865657657963289_n.jpg?oh=0f5ae01c2d4adf0916d9c00149f5e968&oe=5AC1E0E1" alt="" width="50%" height="50%" /></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Again I, along with my friends won another hackathon <strong>Luniva Code Jatra</strong> where we built a tourism 
      webapp <a href="traversity.000webhostapp.com">Traversity</a>.
      It was built on Nodejs and MongoDB.</p>

      <p> On 1st Nobember, 2017 I co-authored an article in The Kathmandu Post regarding "Cybersecurity in Nepal".
       Read it <a href="http://epaper.ekantipur.com/the-kathmandu-post/2017-11-01/6">here.</a>
      </p>

      <p>In my free time I experiment with different technologies. You can view all of my projects
        <a href="http://www.bibhutipoudyal.com.np/#/projects">here</a>. Also I write answers on
        <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Bibhuti-Poudyal">Quora</a>.
        Other than technical stuffs, I like movies, books, Meditation, digital art and Cooking.
        I share all those experiences on my <a href="http://www.bibhutipoudyal.com.np/#/">blog</a>.
